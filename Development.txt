Beanstalk Deployment

> All At Once (In Place): 
    > Deploy all in one go. 
    > Fastest
    > Drawback is instances that aren't available to serve traffic for a bit
    > Traffic downtime during depoyment
    > no additional cost

> Rolling : 
    > Update a few instances at a time
    > Moves onto the next bucket or instance once the previous one is healthy
    > Application not running at capacity
    > No additional cost

> Rolling with additional batches : 
    > Old application still available
    > Spins up new instances instead of updating the previous instance
    > small additional cost
    > Great for production

> Immutable :
    > spins up new instances in a new ASG
    > deploys version to these instances 
    > swaps all the instances when everything is healthy
    > zero downtime
    > In this mode, a full set of new instances running the new version of the application in a separate Auto Scaling Group is launched. 
      To roll back quickly, this mode terminates the ASG holding the new application version, while the current one is untouched and already running         at full capacity.
> Blue Green :
    > creates a new environment
    > switch over when ready
    > zero down time
    > swap url when green
> Traffic Splitting
  > Canary Testing - sends a small % of traffic to new deployment

Queues
    -Standard Queue
        - Retention Period -> 4 to 14 days
        - each message has a max size of 256 kb
        - Producers vs consumers
        - Send message vs Poll message (received)
    - FIFO Queues
    SQS Access Polocy
        - cross account access
        - Publish s3 event notification to SQS queue
    Dead Letter Queue
        - used for debugging messages that exceed maximum receives
        - The dead letter queue of a standard queue must be a standard queue
        - The dead letter queue of a FIFO Queue must be a FIFO Queue
    Long Polling
        - if the consumer is making alot of api calls, this is adivisable to use

SNS 
    - Publisher / Subscription
    - These helps with bulk messaging or anything subscription based. 
    - A filter policy can be added to the Topic based on where messages should end up
    - message receivers can be email, SQS, http e.t.c
Fan OUt Approach:
This is a common pattern where only one message is sent to the SNS topic and then "fan-out" to multiple SQS queues. This approach has the following features: it's fully decoupled, no data loss, and you have the ability to add more SQS queues (more applications) over time.

Kinesis
    - Makes it easy to collect, process and analyze streaming data in real time.
    -ingest real time data such as application logs, metrics, web clickstreeams, IoT telemetry data
    -Kinesis Datastreams
        - streaming service for ingest at scale
        - real time
        - manage scaling (shard splitting/ shard merging)
        - Data storage for 1 to 365 days
        - Supports replay capability
        -use  a highly distributed partition key to avoid hot partitions
        - retries with exponential back off
        - increase shards when needed
        - 1 mb/sec for Producers
        - 2 mb/sec for consumers
        - Kinesis Data Stream uses the partition key associated with each data record to determine which shard a given data record belongs to. When you use the identity of each user as the partition key, this ensures the data for each user is ordered hence sent to the same shard.        
    -Kinesis Firehose
        - Producer : Applcation, kinesis data streams
        - Destination - Amazon s3, redshift, amazon opensearch, http endpoint (custom destination)
        - filly managed
        - near real time
        - no data storage
        - doesnt support replay capability

Global secondary index — an index with a partition key and a sort key that can be different from those on the base table. A global secondary index is considered “global” because queries on the index can span all of the data in the base table, across all partitions.

Local secondary index — an indexhna that has the same partition key as the base table, but a different sort key. A local secondary index is “local” in the sense that every partition of a local secondary index is scoped to a base table partition that has the same partition key value.

Memcached is a more suitable choice since the scenario specifies that the system will run large nodes with multiple cores or threads which Memcached can adequately provide.

You can choose Memcached over Redis if you have the following requirements:

– You need the simplest model possible.

– You need to run large nodes with multiple cores or threads.

– You need the ability to scale out and in, adding and removing nodes as demand on your system increases and decreases.

– You need to cache objects, such as a database.

AWS X-Ray works with Amazon EC2, Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS), AWS Lambda, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. You can use X-Ray with applications written in Java, Node.js, and .NET that are deployed on these services.

AWS CloudTrail is incorrect because this will only enable you to track all API calls to your Lambda, DynamoDB, and SNS. It is still better to use AWS X-Ray to debug your application.

Lambda uses AWS and AWS proxy integration while EC2 uses http and http proxy integration

Take note that the name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be DNS-compliant and must not contain periods (“.”).
