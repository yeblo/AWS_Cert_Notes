Beanstalk Deployment

> All At Once (In Place): 
    > Deploy all in one go. 
    > Fastest
    > Drawback is instances that aren't available to serve traffic for a bit
    > Traffic downtime during depoyment
    > no additional cost

> Rolling : 
    > Update a few instances at a time
    > Moves onto the next bucket or instance once the previous one is healthy
    > Application not running at capacity
    > No additional cost

> Rolling with additional batches : 
    > Old application still available
    > Spins up new instances instead of updating the previous instance
    > small additional cost
    > Great for production

> Immutable :
    > spins up new instances in a new ASG
    > deploys version to these instances 
    > swaps all the instances when everything is healthy
    > zero downtime
    > In this mode, a full set of new instances running the new version of the application in a separate Auto Scaling Group is launched. 
      To roll back quickly, this mode terminates the ASG holding the new application version, while the current one is untouched and already running         at full capacity.
> Blue Green :
    > creates a new environment
    > switch over when ready
    > zero down time
    > swap url when green
> Traffic Splitting
  > Canary Testing - sends a small % of traffic to new deployment

Queues
    -Standard Queue
        - Retention Period -> 4 to 14 days
        - each message has a max size of 256 kb
        - Producers vs consumers
        - Send message vs Poll message (received)
    - FIFO Queues
    SQS Access Polocy
        - cross account access
        - Publish s3 event notification to SQS queue
    Dead Letter Queue
        - used for debugging messages that exceed maximum receives
        - The dead letter queue of a standard queue must be a standard queue
        - The dead letter queue of a FIFO Queue must be a FIFO Queue
    Long Polling
        - if the consumer is making alot of api calls, this is adivisable to use

SNS 
    - Publisher / Subscription
    - These helps with bulk messaging or anything subscription based. 
    - A filter policy can be added to the Topic based on where messages should end up
    - message receivers can be email, SQS, http e.t.c

Kinesis
    - Makes it easy to collect, process and analyze streaming data in real time.
    -ingest real time data such as application logs, metrics, web clickstreeams, IoT telemetry data
    -Kinesis Datastreams
        - shards
    -Kinesis Firehose
    -Kinesis Analytics
