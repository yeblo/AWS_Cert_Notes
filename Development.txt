Beanstalk Deployment

> All At Once (In Place): 
    > Deploy all in one go. 
    > Fastest
    > Drawback is instances that aren't available to serve traffic for a bit
    > Traffic downtime during depoyment
    > no additional cost

> Rolling : 
    > Update a few instances at a time
    > Moves onto the next bucket or instance once the previous one is healthy
    > Application not running at capacity
    > No additional cost

> Rolling with additional batches : 
    > Old application still available
    > Spins up new instances instead of updating the previous instance
    > small additional cost
    > Great for production

> Immutable :
    > spins up new instances in a new ASG
    > deploys version to these instances 
    > swaps all the instances when everything is healthy
    > zero downtime
> Blue Green :
    > creates a new environment
    > switch over when ready
    > zero down time
    > swap url when green
> Traffic Splitting
  > Canary Testing - sends a small % of traffic to new deployment
