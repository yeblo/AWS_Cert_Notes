Beanstalk Deployment

> All At Once (In Place): 
    > Deploy all in one go. 
    > Fastest
    > Drawback is instances that aren't available to serve traffic for a bit
    > Traffic downtime during depoyment
    > no additional cost

> Rolling : 
    > Update a few instances at a time
    > Moves onto the next bucket or instance once the previous one is healthy
    > Application not running at capacity
    > No additional cost

> Rolling with additional batches : 
    > Old application still available
    > Spins up new instances instead of updating the previous instance
    > small additional cost
    > Great for production

> Immutable :
    > spins up new instances in a new ASG
    > deploys version to these instances 
    > swaps all the instances when everything is healthy
    > zero downtime
    > In this mode, a full set of new instances running the new version of the application in a separate Auto Scaling Group is launched. 
      To roll back quickly, this mode terminates the ASG holding the new application version, while the current one is untouched and already running         at full capacity.
> Blue Green :
    > creates a new environment
    > switch over when ready
    > zero down time
    > swap url when green
> Traffic Splitting
  > Canary Testing - sends a small % of traffic to new deployment
